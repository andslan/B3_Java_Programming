    NOTE: FINDS THE BIGGEST AND CHECK IF THE BIGGEST HAS "A" IN IT.
    create a class LongestWithA
    ask the user to enter 3 String inputs. Find and print the longest word that also contains 'a'

    Ex:
        "java"
        "mouse"
        "computer"

    Output: java

    Challenge: Instead of just checking for "a" add another variable that can be used to check for any character.
